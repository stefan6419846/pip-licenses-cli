# pip-licenses-cli

Dump the software license list of Python packages installed with *pip*.

## Description

`pip-licenses-cli` is a CLI tool for checking the software licenses of installed Python packages with pip.

Implemented with the idea inspired by `composer licenses` command in Composer (a.k.a PHP package management tool):
https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#licenses

This is a fork of the original [pip-licenses](https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses) project. While `pip-licenses-cli` provides a CLI,
[pip-licenses-lib](https://github.com/stefan6419846/pip-licenses-lib) provides the library functionality. The CLI builds upon the library.

## Installation

You can install this package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-licenses-cli
```

If you want to additionally parse license declarations with [SPDX expressions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/#spdx-license-expression-syntax), then also install the `spdx` extra:

```bash
python -m pip install 'pip-licenses-cli[spdx]'
```

Alternatively, you can use the package from source directly after installing the required dependencies.

## Usage

Execute the command with your venv (or virtualenv) environment.

```bash
# Install packages in your venv environment
(venv) $ pip install Django pip-licenses-cli

# Check the licenses with your venv environment
(venv) $ pip-licenses
 Name    Version  License
 Django  2.0.2    BSD
 pytz    2017.3   MIT
```

For further details, see [the detailed docs](https://github.com/stefan6419846/pip-licenses-cli/blob/master/USAGE.md).

## About UnicodeEncodeError

If a `UnicodeEncodeError` occurs, check your environment variables `LANG` and `LC_TYPE`.
Additionally, you can set `PYTHONIOENCODING` to override the encoding used for `stdout`.

This mostly occurs in isolated environments such as Docker and tox.
